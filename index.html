<h2>Short Bio </h2>
<p>I am a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate in Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences at UC Berkeley, working with <a href="http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~mlustig/">Prof. Miki Lustig</a> and <a href="http://www1.icsi.berkeley.edu/~stellayu/">Prof. Stella Yu</a>. I am a member of <a href="https://bair.berkeley.edu/">Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research (BAIR)</a>. I also work closely with <a href="http://users.ece.utexas.edu/~jtamir/">Prof. Jon Tamir</a> at UT Austin and <a href="https://www.frankongh.com/">Dr. Frank Ong</a> at Stanford University. I graduated with honor from the department of <a href="http://www.med.tsinghua.edu.cn/">Biomedical Engineering</a> in <a href="http://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/thu2018en/index.html/">Tsinghua University</a> <b>(Happy 110th birthday, Tsinghua!!)</b>. From 2015-2018, I had worked on Magnetic Resonance Temperature Imaging, supervised by Prof. Kui Ying and worked at <a href="http://at3d.med.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/index.html">The Advanced Theranostics and 3-D Imaging Laboratory (AT3D Lab)</a>, supervised by <a href="http://at3d.med.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/members/Professor.html">Prof. Hongen liao</a> for my undergraduate thesis. My research interests lie in <b>computational imaging, deep learning, signal processing, inverse problem, medical imaging and computer vision</b>. I am an enthusiast of science, engineering, music, ice skating, rock climbing and everything related to medicine and healthcare! My name in Chinese is 王可.</p>
<p>I did a wonderful  internship at Adobe Emerging Products Group in the summer of 2021 (Work successfully deployed at PhotoShope Camera)!</p>
<p>I'm interning at Adobe Research as a research scientist intern! (Started from May 2022)</p>
