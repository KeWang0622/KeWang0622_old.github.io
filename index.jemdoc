== Short Bio 
I am a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate in Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences at UC Berkeley, working with [http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~mlustig/ Prof. Miki Lustig] and [http://www1.icsi.berkeley.edu/~stellayu/ Prof. Stella Yu]. I am a member of [https://bair.berkeley.edu/ Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research (BAIR)]. I also work closely with [http://users.ece.utexas.edu/~jtamir/ Prof. Jon Tamir] at UT Austin and [https://www.frankongh.com/ Dr. Frank Ong] at Stanford University. I graduated with honor from the department of [http://www.med.tsinghua.edu.cn/ Biomedical Engineering] in [http://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/thu2018en/index.html/ Tsinghua University] *(Happy 110th birthday, Tsinghua!!)*. From 2015-2018, I had worked on Magnetic Resonance Temperature Imaging, supervised by Prof. Kui Ying and worked at [http://at3d.med.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/index.html The Advanced Theranostics and 3-D Imaging Laboratory (AT3D Lab)], supervised by [http://at3d.med.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/members/Professor.html Prof. Hongen liao] for my undergraduate thesis. My research interests lie in *computational imaging, deep learning, signal processing, inverse problem, medical imaging and computer vision*. I am an enthusiast of science, engineering, music, ice skating, rock climbing and everything related to medicine and healthcare! My name in Chinese is 王可.

I did a wonderful  internship at Adobe Emerging Products Group in the summer of 2021 (Work successfully deployed at PhotoShope Camera)!

I'm interning at Adobe Research as a research scientist intern! (Started from May 2022)

Welcome to check it out! Code is available [https://github.com/mikgroup/UFLoss here]! In this work, we present a patch-based unsupervised learned feature loss (UFLoss), which allows the training of DL-based reconstruction to obtain more detailed texture, finer features and sharper edges with higher overall image quality. Previously presented at ISMRM 2020.
