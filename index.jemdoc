== Short Bio 
I am a first year Ph.D. student in Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences at UC Berkeley, working with [http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~mlustig/ Prof. Miki Lustig]. I graduated with honor from the department of [http://www.med.tsinghua.edu.cn/ Biomedical Engineering] in [http://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/thu2018en/index.html/ Tsinghua University]. From 2015-2018, I have been working on Magnetic Resonance Temperature Imaging, supervised by Prof. Kui Ying and working at [http://at3d.med.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/index.html The Advanced Theranostics and 3-D Imaging Laboratory (AT3D Lab)], supervised by [http://at3d.med.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/members/Professor.html Prof. Hongen liao] for my undergraduate thesis. My research interests lie in computational magnetic resonance imaging, signal processing, medical imaging and computer vision.
